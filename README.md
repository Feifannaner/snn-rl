snn-rl
======

Project goal:

1. Replicate this paper ['Character Recognition using Spiking Neural Networks'](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lnl/papers/Gupta_Long_2007.pdf) .It's a simple experiment on using reinforcement learning on SNN.
2. Make a model that includes dopamine modulation of spike timing dependent plasticity, and apply the same experiment as in 1.
3. If the new model perform better, try more complex data sets, write a gpu implentation and more, If not, improve model :).


## Guidelines

* Feel free to to break things, this is not production code.
* Use the wiki to document and discuss the implementation, and what to do next.
